      "question": "According to the transcript, what is the fundamental goal or 'beauty' of supervised machine learning?",
      "options": [
        "To reduce the dimensions of data by transforming large feature sets into smaller ones.",
        "To create a function f(x) that maps an input variable x to an output variable y.",
        "To group similar objects together without prior knowledge of their labels.",
        "To allow a model to learn through a system of rewards and punishments."
      ],
      "answer": "To create a function f(x) that maps an input variable x to an output variable y."

      "type": "multiple",
      "question": "The transcript explains that Random Forest is an ensemble of decision trees. Besides row sampling (bagging), what additional sampling method does it employ?",
      "options": [
        "Gradient Sampling",
        "Time-Series Sampling",
        "Column Sampling (Feature Bagging)",
        "Stratified Sampling"
      ],
      "answer": "Column Sampling (Feature Bagging)"
    },
    {
      "type": "multiple",
      "question": "The transcript contrasts Bagging and Boosting. What is the primary problem that Boosting is designed to reduce?",
      "options": [
        "High bias",
        "High variance",
        "The need for a meta-classifier",
        "The curse of dimensionality"

      "answer": "High bias"
    },
    {
      "type": "open",
      "question": "Describe the problem of 'overfitting' as explained in the transcript.",
      "answer": "Overfitting is when a model performs very well on the training data, learning it too much, but fails to generalize well to new or testing data, resulting in poor performance on unseen examples."

        "Principal Component Analysis (PCA)",
        "A count vectorizer (or tf-idf vectorizer)",
